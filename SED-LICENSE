SED Specification License (Version 1.0)

Preamble

The SED (Specification Execution Development) concept defines a methodology in which development work follows a structured specification (“SED Spec”). The SED Spec encompasses not only algorithms and source code, but also underlying philosophy, logic, operational design, invisible procedural knowledge, and UI/UX concepts.
This License governs the creation, modification, and use of works derived from an SED Spec.

⸻

1. Ownership of SED-Derived Works

1.1. Any work, result, or output created in accordance with an SED Spec shall be deemed to derive directly from that Spec.
1.2. Even if such work is developed or executed by an artificial intelligence system, the authorship and copyright of the resulting output belong to the original SED Spec Author.
1.3. The reasoning is that the SED Spec itself defines the entire structure, algorithmic intent, and design philosophy of the resulting product; the AI merely follows these instructions without independent creative contribution.

⸻

2. Use of the SED Specification

2.1. Any person, organization, or system wishing to use an SED Spec must obtain explicit written permission from the SED Spec Author before use.
2.2. Unauthorized use of an SED Spec or any portion thereof constitutes a violation of this License and may be subject to legal action.
2.3. Permission may be granted for specific purposes or under specific conditions as defined by the Author.

⸻

3. Modification and Updates

3.1. Anyone modifying, extending, or updating an existing SED Spec must notify the original SED Spec Author of such changes.
3.2. The Original Author retains full copyright over both the original Spec and all subsequent updates or derivative versions.
3.3. Updated versions of the SED Spec may be incorporated into the official SED framework at the discretion of the Author.
3.4. Any derivative SED Spec automatically falls under this same License.

⸻

4. Scope of the SED Spec

4.1. The SED Spec includes, but is not limited to:
	•	Algorithmic definitions and code logic
	•	System architecture and component relationships
	•	Conceptual and philosophical design principles
	•	User interface and user experience paradigms
	•	Invisible operational logic, automation flows, or AI behavioral design
	•	Development procedures, methodologies, and proprietary know-how
4.2. Each of these elements is integral to the SED framework and protected under this License.

⸻

5. AI-Generated Works

5.1. Any output produced by AI through execution of an SED Spec does not constitute independent authorship by the AI or its operator.
5.2. Such output is an extension of the SED Spec itself, and the rights to the resulting work remain with the original SED Spec Author.

⸻

6. Enforcement

6.1. Violation of any provision of this License automatically revokes the violator’s right to use the SED Spec.
6.2. The SED Spec Author reserves the right to pursue all available remedies under intellectual property law.

⸻

7. Governing Law

This License shall be governed and interpreted under the laws of the jurisdiction of the SED Spec Author, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

⸻

8. Definitions
	•	SED Spec: A structured specification embodying code, concept, and operational design.
	•	SED Spec Author: The original creator of the SED Spec.
	•	Derived Work: Any work that implements, follows, or executes an SED Spec.

9. Version and Updates

This License applies to SED Specification License v1.0.
Future revisions may be published by the Author to refine or expand its legal scope.
